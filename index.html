    <!-- The below line is the CDN (Content Delivery Network) for this project. Note that this must come BEFORE your JS file reference below, so that this loads first and you can then reference this in your JS file. Popmotion itself is a "JavaScript library". The below <script> tag is a "compressed version of the library". Using a CDN like this is "the quick and easy way to integrate a library. An average website will have at least ten and as many as hundreds of these DEPENDENCIES. It's not feasible to put all those script tags in your HTML, so there's a better way", which involves Node.js, npm (a Node.js tool), etc. Refer to 'Project_three--integrating_other_peoples_libraries--using_Parcel' to see an example of this. -->
